    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi! I'm Sheela Devi Vembukumar, a passionate and motivated software developer with over 2 years of experience crafting clean, functional web applications using C#, ASP.NET, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MySQL. With a strong foundation in full-stack development, I enjoy building user-friendly interfaces and robust backend APIs.

      Currently, I work at Hawthorn Academy where I support educational technology while continuing to develop impactful side projects such as event management and CRUD-based API applications. My previous experience at WinX Solution in India helped me grow from coding simple interfaces to implementing scalable .NET solutions.
      
      I'm always learning, continuously enhancing my skills in modern web development, cloud technologies, and agile methodologies. My goal is to contribute to innovative software teams that value clean code, collaboration, and real-world impact.</p>
